# APCS
Just a snippet of fun open-ended projects I did in APCS my senior year of high school. The code is admittedly quite messy, but I was quite happy with the results for all of them. Youtube video documenting them: https://youtu.be/9jCeZTC5FQM (at the time, I didn't know how to screen record).

First game (in video): Pepe Avoidal Game -- You're Pepe, avoid bird poop and catch balls!

Second game: Pepe Game -- Modeled after Pokemon, either defeat or capture the other Pepe! (File ending in DankMemes has code for drawing the Pepe, whereas file ending in DankMemers has code for the actual game logic; I was definitely descriptive as a high schooler (sarcasm)).

Third game: Minesweeper (of course, also Pepe themed) -- Basically Minesweeper.
