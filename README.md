# APCS
Just a snippet of fun open-ended projects I did in APCS my senior year of high school. The code is admittedly quite messy, but I was quite happy with the results for all of them. Youtube video documenting them: https://youtu.be/9jCeZTC5FQM (at the time, I didn't know how to screen record).

First game: Pepe Avoidal Game

Second game: Pepe Game

Third game: Minesweeper (of course, also Pepe themed)
